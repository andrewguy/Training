### Imports

One of the powerful aspects of Python (and most other programming languages) is the ability to utilise external libraries and packages to extend the base functionality of Python

It is best-practice to keep all your imports at the top of your file or Notebook.

You can either import a package or library directly:

`import sklearn`

or import a particular subpackage, function or object from a library:

`from sklearn import datasets`

You can also provide an alias for an imported package:

`import numpy as np`

Once a package has been imported, you can access the methods and objects from that package from the package name:

`np.mean([1,2,3,4])`


```python

```
