## Intro to Python

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | None | 3 hour workshop |

### Description

This workshop covers the basics of Python and Jupyter Notebooks, with a focus on using Python for analysing biological data. Python is a user-friendly and widely-supported programming language that has arguably become the language of choice for many data scientists. Jupyter Notebooks are a browser-based Python environment (although not limited to Python - can also run R, Julia, C++, etc) that can contain code, notes, visualisation and equations.

This workshop is designed to provide a solid foundation for the start of your Python journey. There is much more to learn outside of the material presented here!

### Dataset

All the files used for the above lessons are linked within, but can also be [accessed here](https://github.com/andrewguy/training/tree/master/workshops/Intro_to_Python/data).

### Installation Requirements

We will be using Jupyter Lab via [CloudStor](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au) for this tutorial.

If you don't have access to CloudStor, you can also use Jupyter Lab through [Binder](https://jupyter.org/try)

If you wish to run Jupyter Lab locally, the easiest way is to download the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and install on your laptop.
